# Smart Meal Planner

> Welcome to the Smart Meal Planner, a comprehensive meal planner that gives a customized recipe list based on the user's goals. It also gives the user a grocery list for all of the ingredients for all the meals.


## How to use:

### STEP 1 – SET UP

There are some packages that need to be installed before you can get cooking. Type the following into the console, then procede to the next step:

```
    npm install
```

### STEP 2- OPEN SITE
Type the following into the console to open the meal planner:

```
    cd/recpie-app
    npm start
```

### STEP 3 – GENERATE RECIPES

- Step 2 will have opened up the Smart Meal Planner.

- First, navigate to the 'Profile' page (use the side bar on the left) and fill out your dietary restrictions and preferences. Make sure to click 'Save' before continuing through the survey!

- When you have completed the profile to the best of your ability, navigate to the 'Recipe' page. From there, you will be given the choice to generate a single recipe using the 'New Recipe' button and can 'Save Recipe' to add it to your meal plan.

- The 'Calendar' and 'Grocery List' pages will reflect your personal choices and you will be able to explore and format your recipes from here on.
